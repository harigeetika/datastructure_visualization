# Data Structures Visualization

This project is a web-based application designed to visualize common data structures like **Stack**, **Linked List**, **Queue**, **Binary Tree**, and **Deque** using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**. It helps users understand the operations and inner workings of these data structures through interactive visualizations.

- Visualize and interact with common data structures by performing operations such as insertions, insert at position and deletions, and observe real-time updates of the structure.

- The project features a dynamic and user-friendly interface that lets users engage with the data structures. It displays how each structure evolves as operations are performed and detailed explanations about its features, properties, and use cases

- Every data structure is accompanied by a detailed explanation about its features, properties, and use cases. This helps users grasp the theory behind each structure while watching it in action.

- Includes quiz feature that tests your knowledge of the data structures. The timer adds an additional challenge and makes learning more engaging.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface and ensuring itâ€™s interactive.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the functionality of data structure visualizations and interactive elements.
- **PHP**: For server-side handling of quiz scores and user data management.
